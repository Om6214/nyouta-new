          We understand that life can be unpredictable, and sometimes you may need to cancel an order or request a refund. Our cancellation and refund policy is designed to make the process as easy and transparent as possible. We want you to feel confident when shopping with us. 
        </p>
        <p>
          To be eligible for a full refund, you must submit your cancellation request within a specified time frame (typically within 30 days from the date of purchase). Refunds are issued to the original payment method and may take several business days to process, depending on your bank or payment provider. 
        </p>
        <p>
          If you need to cancel your order, please contact us as soon as possible. We strive to process cancellations promptly, but if your order has already been shipped, you may need to follow the return process instead.
        </p>

          Certain products, such as digital goods, personalized items, or perishable goods, may not be eligible for a refund. Please check the product description before making a purchase to understand any restrictions that may apply.

          If you receive a defective or damaged item, we will gladly arrange for a return and refund. Please contact our customer service team within 7 days of receiving the product for assistance. If the product is no longer in stock or unavailable, you will be offered a full refund.
        </p>
        <p>
          Returns must be made in accordance with our return policy. Items should be unused, in the original packaging, and in the same condition as when they were received. If an item is returned in an unsatisfactory condition, we may refuse the refund.
        </p>
        <p>
          We reserve the right to deduct shipping charges or restocking fees from your refund in certain circumstances, such as if you change your mind about a purchase or if the return is outside the allowed time frame.

        <p>
          We strive to handle cancellations and refunds promptly and fairly. If you have any concerns or need assistance with the process, please do not hesitate to contact us. Your satisfaction is our priority, and we are happy to help resolve any issues you may encounter.
